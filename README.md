# fastdds-discovery-server-demo

Using [Fast DDS Discovery Server](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Discovery-Server/Discovery-Server.html) with multiple hosts connected over the Internet with Husarnet p2p VPN.

## Intro

According to the docs: *the Fast DDS Discovery Server protocol is a feature that offers a centralized dynamic discovery mechanism, as opposed to the distributed mechanism used in DDS by default.*

This feature is especially important for ROS 2 devices that are not connected to the same WiFi router, and thus multicasting (used for a standard DDS discovery) is not efficient enough, not convenient or even is not possible.

This repo presents **how to use FastDDS Discovery Server in a ROS 2 talker/listener demo**. Each device can be in different network, and **public IP is not required**.

The Discovery Server is used only during a service discovery phase. The actual messages are forwarded with minimal latency between devices thanks to [Husarnet peer-to-peer VPN](https://github.com/husarnet/husarnet).

## Get your Husarnet Join Code

Before running examples get your **Husarnet Join Code**. You will use it to connect Docker containers to the same VPN network.

At first rename `.env.template` file to `.env`.

You will find your Join Code at **https://app.husarnet.com  
 -> Click on the desired network  
 -> `Add element` button  
 -> `Join code` tab**

â€¦and change the `HUSARNET_JOINCODE` variable in the `.env` files.

## Get the `ros:galactic` image with `Fast DDS v2.4.0`

Fast DDS is not a default RMW in ROS 2 Galactic. Also *hostnames* for DDS Discovery Server in Fast DDS `.xml` files **are not supported in versions < `v2.4.0`** that are available in the package repository (installed with `apt-get install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-rmw-fastrtps-cpp`). 

This is why we need to build a new Docker Image based on `ros:galactic` with `Fast DDS v2.4.0` built from source.

### Docker registry (`ARM64` and `AMD64`)

Building `Fast DDS v2.4.0` from source takes a while (especially for `ARM64`) so you can use a prebuild image from this repo:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/dominikn/ros-galactic-fastdds:v2.4.0
```

### Local build

The Docker image is built from this repo: https://github.com/DominikN/ros-galactic-fastdds.

## Deployment

Prepare 3 devices (eg. laptop, Raspberry Pi etc.) with Docker and Docker-Compose installed. They could be in the same, or in different Ethernet/WiFi/LTE networks.

> **ðŸ’¡ Tip**
>
> You can also run those 3 Docker Compose deployments on one laptop if you don't want to test it over the Internet

In this demo we will deploy different `docker.compose.yml` files on different devices:

- **DDS Discovery Server** launched by `docker-compose.discovery-server.yml`
- **Listener** (from [demo-nodes-cpp](https://github.com/ros2/demos/tree/master/demo_nodes_cpp) ROS 2 package) launched by `docker-compose.listener.yml`
- **Talker** (from [demo-nodes-cpp](https://github.com/ros2/demos/tree/master/demo_nodes_cpp) ROS 2 package) launched by `docker-compose.talker.yml`

### DDS Discovery Server

```bash
docker compose -f compose.discovery-server.yaml up
```

### Listener

```bash
docker compose -f compose.listener.yaml up
```

### Talker

```bash
docker compose -f compose.talker.yaml up
```

## Result

Eg. log from a `listener` deployment:

```
